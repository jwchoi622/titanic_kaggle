# titanic_kaggle
* Data science project using pandas and seaborn to look at the data. Then I used
* a regression model to make a prediction. 

#Overview
* Using pandas and seaborn I was able to get a good idea of the data I was working with.
* Then using a logistic regression I made a predictor of which passengers would have survived 
* the accident. It has 79% accuracy with minimal tuning.

* I could have done some more tuning to get higher accuracy but after a long layoff from
* data science work, this project just helped me familiarize myself with the concepts.
